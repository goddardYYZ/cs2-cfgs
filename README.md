# How to use a cfg (config)
CS2 configs should be placed under ‘Steam’ -> ‘steamapps’ -> ‘common’ -> ‘Counter-Strike: Global Offensive‘ -> ‘game’ -> ‘csgo’ -> ‘cfg’

Once you’re in this location, simply paste your CS2 config and you’re ready!

Then launch CS2, open the console (~) and then type "exec name-of-config.cfg"
